# Tree6z – Booking Site That Actually Works

## The Deal

Client needed a way to stop taking bookings over the phone.  
I built them a site where people pick a job, pick a day, pay — done.  
They use it every day. No crashes. No drama.

## What It Does

- Customer books a tree trim → picks date → pays with card  
- Owner logs in → sees all jobs → clicks “done”  
- Emails fire off automatically  
- Works on phones (most people book from the field)
